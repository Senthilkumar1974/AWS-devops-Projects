does a onetime deployment,  
Code Pipeline for scheduling of deployment you may have to use AWS Code Pipeline also. 
Scope of the Project : 
  1.Developer Developing Application code & Stored the source code file into Storage 
container (S3 Bucket)., the code Repository 
2.The CODE DEPLOYMENT Tool Fetch the file from the code Repository  S3, and  deploy to 
the Web server or deployment Machine by Serive using Code Deploy Agent.  
This is one time Deployment Process. 
3. This process 1 & 2 may have happened again and again, and the repeated process has 
watch / monitored by a monitoring tool Cloud WATCH. If The code refreshed / reinitiate 
/newcode update like process , the monitoring tool will check &  inform to the continues / 
scheduled deployment tool Code PIPELINE about  the changes that happened in the code 
Repository  S3.  
Here the the continues / scheduled deployment tool Code PIPELINE acts a Manager, 
4.To manages the new code availability / modification happened / anay chages occured
The Code Pipeline instruct  to Code Deploy about the modifications happened in Storage 
container and ask the Code Deployer to Deploy the new changes to Webserver.  
5.Deployment Success ,  the Code PIPELINE send notifications about the changes to 
clients/customers through SNS messaging / mailing service.
